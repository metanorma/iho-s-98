== Use of Context Parameters

The Portrayal Catalogue for a product contains the set of parameters
which are used in the portrayal processing for that product.
This set may be different for different products. Context parameters
are used for passing portrayal-related configuration information and
user settings to portrayal processing, and the values of context parameters
may therefore be changed by user functions, including those defined
in the IMO Performance Standards, in this document, or manufacturers'
custom user functions.

In order to be able to use the official Portrayal Catalogue for a
data product, manufacturers must implement all the context parameters
listed in the Portrayal Catalogue.

Context parameters may be added or removed by updates to the Portrayal
Catalogue. Context parameters which cannot be automatically associated
with ECDIS display functions or user interface features must be exposed
to the Mariner for use.
