== Manual Updates

=== Introduction

Manual updates are data entered manually into the ENDS/ENC. Manual
updates are entered by the mariner to add, delete or modify features
in an ENC. In order to provide a harmonised and consistent approach
to manual updates on the ECDIS a set of portrayal symbols is supplied
alongside this publication. As a minimum, the symbols and attributes
listed in <<table_8>>, <<table_9>> and <<table_10>> must be supported.

Indications and alerts must be triggered as for all official ENC data.

In order to provide a harmonised and consistent approach to manual
editing and update on the ECDIS a set of portrayal symbols is supplied
alongside this publication. These symbols, contained within an S-100
portrayal catalogue and feature catalogue allow the OEM to implement
a manual update and editing feature on the ECDIS.

A visual index of the supplied symbols is provided in this Appendix
in the following tables.

=== Attribution of Manual Update Features

Features added by manual updates must support attribution as defined
in the Manual Updates feature catalogue. A feature catalogue containing
the data structures which must be supported by the manual updates
also accompanies this publication.

The supplied feature catalogue contains a restricted set of features
and attributes compatible with those used for S-101 electronic charts
which enable portrayal and required alert and indication processing
to be carried out on manually entered updates.
