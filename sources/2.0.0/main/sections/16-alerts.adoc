== Alerts and Indications

IMO Resolution MSC.530(106)/Rev.1 states in 11.3 and 11.4 and their
sub-paragraphs how an ECDIS should respond to risk of crossing, dangers,
prohibited areas or areas with special conditions, during route planning
(11.3) or route monitoring (11.4). Appendix 4 and Appendix 5 of the
same resolution provide details about the areas for which an ECDIS
should detect incursions and provide an alert or indication.

=== Multiple spatial objects.

If multiple spatial objects are identified then the union of those
spatial objects must be highlighted. If the same spatial object identifies
an alert and an indication then the drawing order must be the alert
highlight followed by the drawing highlight.
