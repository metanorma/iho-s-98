== Display Elements

This section describes additional display elements and special symbols
and considerations for ENC data, including chart furniture, contours,
mariner's features, IMO-required elements, and presentation of updates.

Cursor pick reports and information displays in off-graphic panels
are described in <<sec_15>>.

=== Elements related to data and display scales

ENC Features are contained within DataCoverage features and aggregated
into datasets. Each DataCoverage feature contains attributes
_optimumDisplayScale_, _minimumDisplayScale_ and _maximumDisplayScale_.
The algorithm which must be used for the selection and rendering of
ENC features is contained in <<annexE>> - Dataset Loading and Display
(Rendering) Algorithms

[[sec_12.1.1]]
==== ENC scale

The term "scale" is used to describe either:

* Display Scale, or (equivalently) Mariner Selected Viewing Scale
(MSVS)
* The scale of the source data used to compile the ENC.
* Data Scale (the values used for the DataCoverage attributes
_minimumDisplayScale_, _maximumDisplayScale_, _optimumDisplayScale_.
This may not be the same as the scale of the source data used to compile
the ENC. These values define the range of scales at which ENC coverage
is intended to be displayed.

The S-101 ENC values used for the Data Scale attributes _minimumDisplayScale_
and _optimumDisplayScale_ are fixed, and taken from the table below:

._minimumDisplayScale_ and _optimumDisplayScale_ values
[cols="^",options="unnumbered"]
|===
h| Scale

| NULL
| 1:10,000,000
| 1:3,500,000
| 1:1,500,000
| 1:700,000
| 1:350,000
| 1:180,000
| 1:90,000
| 1:45,000
| 1:22,000
| 1:12,000
| 1:8,000
| 1:4,000
| 1:3,000
| 1:2,000
| 1:1,000
|===

The ordering and selection of *Data Coverage* features by Data Scale,
prior to S-101 portrayal is defined fully in <<annexE>> - Dataset
Loading and Display (Rendering) Algorithms.

[[sec_12.2]]
=== Display of Non-ENC data layers

Non-ENC data layers may not contain DataCoverage features. Where the
dataset discovery metadata entries for non-ENC datasets contains values
*_minimumDisplayScale_* and *_maximumDisplayScale_* these values define
the range of display scales for which a non-ENC dataset is intended
to be displayed.

Where the dataset discovery metadata do not contain values for
minimumDisplayScale and maximumDisplayScale the ECDIS must display
the dataset by default but may drop display in the interests of system
resources.

There is no algorithm defined for the selection and rendering of non-ENC
data.

[[sec_12.3]]
=== Overscale

Data is overscale when displayed at a scale larger than its *_optimumDisplayScale_*.

[discrete]
==== Overscale Indication

The overscale indication is intended to remind the mariner that chart
errors are magnified as the display scale is increased.
A stem:[1 "unitsml(mm)"] error at a display scale of 1:20,000 becomes
a stem:[1.3 "unitsml(mm)"] error at a display scale of 1:15,000 and
a stem:[2 "unitsml(mm)"] error at 1:10,000. The overscale indication
is specific to ENC portrayal.

The overscale factor must be calculated as:

[denominator of the
*_optimumDisplayScale_* ] / [denominator of the mariner's 
selected viewing scale]

and expressed as, for example "X1.3", or "X2"
(using the figures in the example above.)

When the overscale factor is > 1 it must be indicated on the same
screen as the chart display, and treated as display base. Use colour
SCLBR.

This overscale indication is required by IMO Performance Standards
(MSC.530(106)/Rev.1) and must be shown whenever the overscale factor
at the vessel location (when the vessel is on screen), or at the centre
of the screen (when the vessel is not on screen), exceeds 1.

==== Chart Scale boundary

Where the *_optimumDisplayScale_* of the ENC data available changes
the ECDIS should warn the mariner of upcoming ENC scale change. Only
the major changes in *_optimumDisplayScale_* resulting from the scale
jumping more than three steps in *_optimumDisplayScale_* should be
shown. The steps are the defined scale bands in the display Loading
and rendering <<table_11>>.

The "chart scale boundaries", where the *_optimumDisplayScale_* of
the data changes by more than three steps, must be symbolised on the
ECDIS display by a solid 0.32mm wide line using colour token CHGRD.
Alternatively, linestyle SCLBDY51 may be used. The display priority
is 9; over-radar; standard display; viewing group 21030.

When scale boundaries of smaller scale *Data Coverage* areas overlap
larger scale *Data Coverage* areas, that portion of the scale boundary
which intersects the larger scale *Data Coverage* area should not
be visible.

==== Overscale Pattern

ECDIS displays all chart data at the same (mariner selected) viewing
scale. In order to avoid leaving parts of the display blank, the display
may be rendered using data from multiple datasets using the algorithm
defined in <<annexE>> - Dataset Loading and Display (Rendering) Algorithms.
These datasets may contain *Data Coverage* areas with different *_optimumDisplayScale*_.

The area fill OVERSC01 must be used to indicate *Data Coverage* areas
displayed larger than the *_maximumDisplayScale_*, when the area has
been selected for display by the ECDIS in order to avoid leaving that
portion of the display blank. These Data Coverage areas are those
selected after stage 3.b is reached in the SelectDataCoverages function
in <<annexE>> - Dataset Loading and Display (Rendering) Algorithms.

For example, an overscale situation arises when the ship approaches
a scale boundary from a larger to a smaller scale ENC, typically when
leaving harbour. In combining data from the large scale and the small
scale ENCs to generate a display at the larger scale, the ECDIS will
have "grossly enlarged" the small scale data.

In addition to drawing the scale boundaries, the "grossly overscale"
part of the display must be identified with area fill OVERSC01, as
illustrated in <<fig_1>>.

[[fig_1]]
.Illustration of overscale display
image::figure-01.jpeg["",499,255]

In this context, "grossly enlarged" and "grossly overscale" should
be taken to mean that the display scale is enlarged/overscale with
respect to the *_maximumDisplayScale_*. For example, at the left edge
of the display scale of 1/12,500 is larger than the *_maximumDisplayScale_*
of 1/50,000, and so the overscale pattern is required.

Note that in this situation the OVERSC01 area fill should only be
shown on the area compiled from the smaller scale ENC. If the area
from the larger scale ENC is also overscale, this should be indicated
only by the "overscale indication". The OVERSC01 area fill should
not be shown on the part of the display taken from the larger scale
ENC

For example if the display scale (MSVS) 1:3,500 is selected, the area
of *_optimumDisplayScale_* 1:12,500 would have an overscale indication
of X 3.6 but would have no OVERSC01 area fill.

==== Larger scale data available

As the mariner's display window moves and begins to cover an ENC that
is of a larger *_optimumDisplayScale_*, the ECDIS must indicate when
the ship's position enters the larger scale ENC, as required by
MSC.530(106)/Rev.1 6.1.2.

[[sec_12.4]]
=== Graphical indexes

==== Graphical indexes of ENCs

The system *must* be capable of displaying a graphical index of ENCs.

All datasets installed on the system must be included in the graphical
index.

Additionally:

* ENC Discovery metadata from Exchange Catalogue files in Exchange
Sets
* Installed S-128 datasets (data which may be available, but which
is not installed) may be used to generate ENC graphical index as long
as the graphical index distinguishes them from the datasets installed
on the system.

The description of dataset extents in S-101 ENC discovery metadata
in exchange catalogue files uses a fixed format, described in <<annexF>>.

It must be possible to individually select the display of the graphical
index entries for the installed S-57 and S-101 ENCs. The display of
each data product must be differentiated.

==== Graphical indexes of other S-100 products

The ECDIS must additionally implement a capability for displaying
graphical indexes of S-102 and S-104 data products, and may implement
a graphical index of other non-ENC data products

If the system displays graphical indexes for different products simultaneously
it must be possible to individually select the display of each supported
data product. The display of each supported data product shall be
differentiated.

[[sec_12.5]]
=== Limits of data

[[sec_12.5.1]]
==== ENC No data areas

The ECDIS must fill any areas in which there is no installed ENC coverage
using area pattern NODATA03, using colour token NODTA. These areas
are defined as no data areas.

The indication "**__No ENC Available__**" must be shown if the display
includes areas in which there are waters with no ENCs installed.

An indication that the mariner must refer to the official chart must
also be given whenever line style NONHODAT appears on the display,
or whenever the display is comprised of other than ENC data as specified
by <<sec_9.1.1>>.

[[sec_12.5.2]]
==== Limit of official S-101 data and non official S-101 data

The limit of official S-101 data on the graphical index defines the
limit of official ENC coverage. The definition of official data as
opposed to non official data is contained in <<sec_9.1.1>>.

The appearance of the "No data" colour (colour token NODTA) and NODATA03
area fill (see <<sec_12.5.1>>) will indicate the end of official data.

If non-official chart data is shown on the ECDIS display, its boundary
must be demarcated by the line style NONHODAT. Note that the NONHODAT
line style is a "one-sided" line and the boundary of the non official
data must be drawn according to S-101 rules to ensure that the diagonal
stroke of the line is on the non official data side of the line.
The non official data boundary indicated by the NONHODAT line style
serves to separate official ENC data from non official chart information.

==== Limits of other S-100 product data

For all other supported data products, it must be possible for the
mariner to be able to individually select for display the "no data"
areas and "non official data" boundaries. The display for each supported
data product must be differentiated.

For gridded data, the no-data area limits do not need to demarcate
areas within the grid extent which are covered by fill values.

NOTE: For some types of coverage products (for example gridded data),
no-data areas may be easily distinguished by the lack of portrayal.
Nevertheless, consistent treatment of products is required for the
convenience of the mariner - either this clause should be implemented
for all the non-ENC S-100 products, or for none of them.

=== Special ECDIS chart symbols to identify unsafe depths

The ECDIS highlights four concepts that are important for safe navigation.
These are the safety contour, depth shades, the safety depth and isolated
dangers. Depth shades, safety depth and isolated dangers are implemented
in the portrayal catalogue.

==== Safety Contour

The own-ship safety contour is double-coded by a thick line and a
prominent change in depth shade.

If the safety contour selected by the mariner is not available in
the System Database, the ECDIS must default to next deeper contour
and inform the mariner. If the ship moves onto a new chart, and the
safety contour previously in use is no longer available, the ECDIS
must again select the next deeper contour, and inform the mariner.

If the mariner does not select a safety contour, the value must default
to 30 metres.

=== Date-dependent features

There are a number of features within the Marine environment which
are seasonal, such as racing buoys. These features are only to be
displayed over a certain period, S-101 uses the complex attribute
_periodicDateRange_ with the sub attributes _dateStart_ and _dateEnd_
to indicate the periodic nature of the feature. Other features, such
as traffic separation schemes, use the complex attribute _fixedDateRange_
with the sub attributes _dateStart_ and _dateEnd_ to indicate their
introduction or removal. In order for the Mariner to receive important
changes to traffic separation schemes before the event, HOs are required
to provide updates or new editions containing the alterations at least
one month before they come into force. Any S-101 feature with one
of the above complex attributes must not be displayed outside its
effective dates unless requested by the Mariner.

==== Display of date-dependent features by mariner-selected date

To provide the Mariner with effective route planning capabilities
and for the look-ahead function during route monitoring ECDIS must
display date dependent chart data based on a Mariner selected date
or date range (start viewing date and end viewing date).

During route planning and monitoring the Mariner must be able to select
a date or date range to display all date dependent chart features.

[example]
A new traffic separation scheme is coming into effect on 01.01.2013,
it has been encoded by the ENC producer using the attribute _dateStart_.
The current date is 12.12.2012 and the Mariner is planning a route
that will cross this area over the effective start period.

In this case the ECDIS must be capable of providing the Mariner the
ability to set the date the vessel will be in the area
(e.g. 02.01.2013 in the above example) and the system should show
the new traffic scheme.

==== Indication of date adjustment

When viewing date or date range do not include the current date, the
mariner must be informed by a permanent indication on the chart display
that the date has been adjusted. The indication must begin with the
text "Display Not Real Time" and the selected date or date range must
be readily available.

The use of one of the following formats is recommended:

* Display Not Real Time - Display is based on date dd mmm yyyy
* Display Not Real Time - Display is based on viewing date range from
dd mmm yyyy to dd mmm yyyy

=== Decluttering the screen

To reduce screen clutter some features within ENC carry the attribute
_scaleMinimum_ to specify the smallest display scale at which they
are to be portrayed. At display scales smaller than _scaleMinimum_
the drawing instructions output from the portrayal engine must not
be drawn.

For example, the drawing instructions for a feature with a _scaleMinimum_
value of 49999, (indicating a display scale of 1:49,999), must not
be drawn on an ECDIS with a display scale of 1:50,000.

=== IMO presentation elements

In some cases, S-101 does not provide a symbology instruction in the
Portrayal Catalogue that specifies how to present a specific feature
on the ECDIS screen. The reason is that such a feature is not defined
as an S-101 feature type or it would be illogical to include it in
the Mariners' navigational feature types.

The following presentation instructions are therefore provided to
assist the manufacturer.

==== Scale bar and latitude scale

The IMO Performance Standards require an indication of scale and range
as part of the Display Base. The display scale determines which must
be used:

. Case 1: for display scales larger than 1/80,000: always display
the 1 Nautical Mile scale bar provided in the Portrayal Catalogue
. Case 2: for display scales at 1/80,000 or smaller: always display
the 10 Nautical Mile latitude scale provided in the Portrayal Catalogue.

The scale bar or latitude scale must always be drawn vertically at
the left side of the chart display, just clear of the border of the
display. The symbols and drawing parameters are described in <<table_1>>.

The placement must be 3mm in from the border of the display. The symbol
must be properly sized to represent 1 nautical mile at the scale of
the display (for Case 1) or 10 nautical miles at the scale of the
display (for Case 2).

[[table_1]]
.Scale bar presentation parameters
[cols="^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^"]
|===
h| Scale range h| Symbol h| Drawing priority h| Display plane h| Display category h| Viewing group

| 1:80000 and smaller scale | SCALEB11
|===

[example]
For _display scales_ larger than 1/80,000
(for example, a scale of 1/50,000) draw symbol 'SCALEB10' on the left
side of the chart display, bottom justified and 3mm in from the border
of the display. Make sure the symbol should be sized to represent
1 nautical mile (1852 m) at the scale of the display.

[example]
For display scales of 1/80,000 or smaller (for example, 1/250,000)
use symbol 'SCALEB11', similarly located, and scaled to represent
10 miles at the scale of the display.

IEC define a requirement for indicating the location at which the
scale is calculated under certain circumstances.

==== North arrow

A north arrow must be provided as part of the Display Base according
to the IMO Performance Standard. The north arrow must always be shown
at the top left corner of the chart display, just clear of the scale
bar or latitude scale. Other requirements for the north arrow are
defined in IEC 61174.

The symbol 'NORTHAR1' must be used to indicate true north.
It must be placed in the top left corner of the chart display, on
the inner side of the scalebar. It must be rotated to true north if
the display is other than north up, and clear of the scalebar even
if the latter extends the full height of the display.

|===

==== Graticule

If the ECDIS shows a graticule (listed in "other information" in IMO
Performance Standards (MSC.530(106)/Rev.1)) the lines must use the
colour token CHBLK.

==== Display mode

The ECDIS manufacturer must provide the indication of display mode
required in the display base by IMO Performance Standards
(MSC.530(106)/Rev.1 Appendix 2).

==== Black level adjustment symbol

Unless the brightness and contrast controls of the monitor are properly
adjusted there is a danger that information may be lost from the chart
display, particularly at night. Symbol BLKADJ is provided for checking
correct adjustment and for re-adjusting as necessary. The BLKADJ symbol
is provided as a part of ECDIS Chart 1, see <<sec_19.5>>

==== Detection and notification of navigational hazards

The IMO Performance Standard for ECDIS MSC.530(106)/Rev.1,
clause 11.3.7 Route planning states:

____
A graphical indication should also be given if the mariner plans a
route closer than a user-specified distance from a user-selectable
category of point objects, such as a fixed or floating aid to navigation
or isolated danger.
____

Clause 11.4.6 Route monitoring states:

____
ECDIS should give a warning or caution or indication as selected by
the mariner and related graphical indication if, continuing on its
present course and speed, over a specified time or distance set by
the mariner, own ship will pass closer than a user-specified distance
from a user-selectable category of danger
(e.g. obstruction, wreck, rock) that is shallower than the mariner's
safety contour or a user-selectable category of aid to navigation.
____

Clause 11.4.8 Route Monitoring states:

____
A graphical indication should be given if the current or the next
leg of the selected route goes closer than a user-specified distance
from the boundary of a user-selectable category of prohibited area
or a geographic area for which special conditions exist.
____

The ECDIS must implement support for the Alert and Indications Catalogue
which may be provided within each product's Portrayal Catalogue.

The safety contour value is set by the user; in the absence of a user
setting, its default value must be 30m.

The highlight must indicate the intersection between the ship's look-ahead
buffer (computed using speed, course, look-ahead time and cross-track
deviation) and the spatial components associated with alert instructions
output by the portrayal.

<<fig_2>> depicts indication highlights for points, curves, and surfaces.

[[fig_2]]
.Examples of indication highlights
image::figure-02.png["",440,325]

==== Detection of areas for which special conditions exist

The IMO Performance Standard for ECDIS MSC.530(106)/Rev.1,
clause 11.3.7 (which applies to Route Planning) states:

____
A graphical indication should be given if the mariner plans a route
closer than a user-specified distance from the boundary of a user-selectable
category of prohibited area or geographic area for which special conditions
exist (see appendix 4).
____

Clause 11.4.4 Route Monitoring states;

____
ECDIS should give a warning or caution, or indication, as selected
by the mariner, and related graphical indication if, within a specified
time or distance set by the mariner, own ship will pass closer than
a user-selected distance from the boundary of a user-selectable category
of prohibited area or of a geographical area for which special conditions
exist (see appendix 4).
____

The ECDIS must implement support for Alert and Indications Catalogues.

==== Definition of safety contour

The safety contour is defined as the boundary between safe and unsafe
areas of the display.

==== Detection of safety contour

The IMO Performance Standard for ECDIS MSC.530(106)/Rev.1,
clause 11.3.6 Route Planning states;

____
A graphical indication is required if the mariner plans a route closer
than a user-specified distance from own ship's safety contour.
____

Clause 11.4.3 Route Monitoring states;

____
It should be possible to select that ECDIS gives an alarm and related
graphical indication if, within a specified time or distance set by
the mariner, own ship will pass closer than a user-selected distance
from the safety contour.
____

Clause 11.4.7 Route Monitoring states:

____
A graphical indication should be given if the current or the next
leg of the selected route passes closer than a user-specified distance
from the safety contour.
____

The ECDIS must implement support for Alert and Indications Catalogues

The point, curve or surface must be graphically indicated using the
presentation named as "DNGHLT" in the S-101 Portrayal Catalogue, as
depicted in <<fig_3>>.

[[fig_3]]

==== Indications related to ENC accuracy

The IMO Performance Standard for ECDIS MSC.530(106)/Rev.1,
clause 11.3.6 Route Planning states;

____
11.3.8 It should be possible for the mariner to select that the indications
of 11.3.6 and 11.3.7 take into account accuracy information of relevant
hydrographic information, as defined by IHO standards.
____

Clause 11.4.9 Route Monitoring states;

____
11.4.9 It should be possible for the mariner to select that the indications
of 11.4.3, 11.4.4, 11.4.6, 11.4.7 and 11.4.8 take into account accuracy
information of relevant hydrographic information, as defined by IHO
standards.
____

When the Mariner has chosen to take accuracy of hydrographic information
into account the ECDIS must use a _zoneOfConfidence_ attribute to
extend the check area in a horizontal direction for route plans
(closer than a user-specified distance) and for own ship
(within a specified time or distance set by the mariner, own ship
will pass closer than a user-selected distance).

==== Check area extension value - S-101 only

When the ECDIS is using S-101 without any S-102 depth substitution
or S-104 depth adjustment the S-101 QualityOfBathymetricData feature
contains a zoneOfConfidence complex attribute. This provides either
a _horizontalPositionUncertainty_ sub-attribute If no
_horizontalPositionUncertainty_ value is available then the amount
of extension must be taken from the sub-attribute _categoryOfZoneOfConfidence_
according to the following table of default values:

[[table_3]]
.categoryOfZoneOfConfidence and Accuracy values.
[cols="111,68"]
|===
h| _categoryOfZoneOfConfidence value_ h| Positional Accuracy

| A1    | 5m
| A2    | 20m
| B     | 50m
| C     | 500m
| D     | 500m
| U     | 500m
|===

==== Check area extension value - S-102 depth substitution

When the depth information in the S-101 is substituted by S-102 the
__zoneOfConfidence.horizontalPositionUncertainty.__uncertaintyFixedin
the QualityOfBathymetryCoverage feature attribute table
(S-100 Part 10c, 9.6.2) from the S-102 must be used instead of the
S-101 feature information as defined in the last clause if it is set.
If this value is not available then the S-101 value defined in the
previous clause must be used instead.

==== Check area extension value - S-102 depth substitution and S-104 adjustment

When the depth values in the S-101 are substituted for S-102 and also
adjusted by the S-104 values (as documented in <<annexD>>) then the
total value for the extension of the check area, as defined in the
previous clause must then be further adjusted by adding the uncertainty
value in the S-104 feature attribute table
_zoneOfConfidence.horizontalPositionUncertainty.uncertaintyFixed_
if defined.

For example, when the ECDIS is using S-101 only, if the value of
"closer than user specified distance is 100 m and if the value of
_categoryOfZoneOfConfidence_ is A2 (a value of 20 m from the table
of defaults) then the check is extended in the horizontal direction
up to 120 m.

[[fig_9]]
.Example Danger Highlight extended by underlaying value of *_categoryOfZoneOfConfidence_*, left is without extension and right is with extension
image::figure-09.png["",602,206]

For the S-101 case, when multiple QualityOfBathymetricData features
with different _categoryOfZoneOfConfidence_ values underlay the check
area, then the value of extension changes at the point where the original
non-extended check area crosses the boundary of the QualityOfBathymetricData
areas with different _categoryOfZoneOfConfidence_ values, see the
example below:

[[fig_10]]
.Example Extension of check-area by multiple underlaying *QualityOfBathymetricData* areas with different values of *_categoryOfZoneOfConfidence_*
image::figure-10.png["",601,329]

==== Enhanced Safety Contour and Water Level Adjustment.

The term "Enhanced Safety Contour" means a safety contour created
from bathymetric grid data using the value set by the user.
With ENCs the user sets a value for the safety contour, but if a contour
of that value is not found in the ENC then the safety contour defaults
to the next deepest available contour which can be substantially deeper
than the value requested by the user.

Bathymetric grid data allows the user the ability to define a value
and for the system to delineate areas of safe and unsafe water based
on that value. The areas defined can then be used for the definition
of safety contour and attendant alerts/indications. When this is done
contextual ENC features with depth information are also substituted
from the bathymetric grid to present the user a harmonised picture.

The combination of S-101 with S-102 and S-104 together enable Water
Level Adjustment (WLA), allowing the water level data contained in
S-104 to complement the S-102 and S-101 chart data. As with depth
information, WLA processes adjust attribute values in the ENC data
to present the user with a harmonised picture.

<<annexD>> defines the detailed mechanisms for Enhanced Safety Contour
and Water Level Adjustment. The ECDIS must support the Enhanced Safety
Contour and Water Level Adjustment features.

=== Other specified display features

==== Legend

A standard legend of general information relating to the area displayed,
applicable to the position selected by the mariner, must be shown
on a graphic or text display. This legend must contain at minimum
(and, as applicable):

. Scale of display; in addition overscale indication where appropriate;
. Data quality indicator;
. Sounding/vertical datum;
. Horizontal datum;
. The value of the safety depth if used;
. The value of the safety contour selected by the mariner, as well
as the value of the safety contour displayed (which may be different
from that selected by the mariner);
. Method of Water Level Adjustment (if enabled)
. Magnetic variation;
. Date and number of last update(s) affecting the datasets currently
in use;
. Edition number and date of issue of the datasets currently in use;
. Display projection.

Since attempting to display all the above items for all displayed
data products may lead to an unduly large legend, manufacturers may
suppress information from data products other than ENCs. If this is
done, the suppressed information should be available through simple
operator action, such as a temporary expansion of the legend activated
by clicking on a target in the legend. (Note that some of the items
will be the same for all data products - in particular, units and
datums should be the same for all products, or converted to present
the same display result, in order to reduce the chances of user error.)

==== Legend details

The legend must additionally indicate the vertical datum of any S-102
and S-104 used for Enhanced Safety Contour and Water Level Adjustment
on the display. If the vertical datums are the same then a single
indication is enough to cover S-101, S-102 and S-104.

==== ECDIS Legend

The ECDIS chart legend containing the items in <<table_4>> must be
available for display for a position selected by the Mariner.

- If a single attribute value is valid for the selected viewing date
range, that value must be displayed.
If multiple values are valid for the selected viewing date range,
the worst-case value must be displayed.When multiple features are
present (to indicate bathymetric data quality at various depths):
- The feature which intersects the specified safety contour value
must be used.

. Total _horizontalPositionUncertainty_ of the
*Quality Of Non-Bathymetric Data* (M_ACCY) meta-feature if available.

NOTE: Due to the way quality is encoded in the ENC, both values
(a and b) must be provided

|===

The list above is the minimum that must be available, but the complete
list need not always be shown. Individual items may be picked by the
mariner for display for a period; examples are magnetic variation,
data quality for depths, etc.

=== Displaying manual and automatic updates and added information

[[sec_12.11.1]]
==== Manual updates

It must be possible to make the following manual updates to an ENC:

* Add feature
* Delete feature
* Modify feature

A manually updated feature must be capable of the same performance
in feature selection, response to cursor-picking, etc, as an ENC feature.
In addition, it must provide updating information (identification
and source of update, when and by whom entered, etc) on cursor picking

Manual chart updates, which are subject to human error, must be distinguished
from official information and updates applied automatically. Additionally:

. *Keying and Symbology*. The mariner must be able to enter manual
updates for presentation on the display. A capacity should exist to
enable the mariner to:

.. Enter the update so it can be displayed as described in this specification.

.. Ensure all update text information relevant to the new condition
and to the source of the update, as entered by the Mariner, is recorded
by the system for display on demand.

. *Indications and Alerts*. The ECDIS should provide indications and
alerts related to manual updates, using the same criteria as for ENC
features.
. *Presentation*. Manual updates must be displayed as described in
this clause. A selection of standardised symbols must be made available
for preparing hand-entered chart corrections. The original chart features
must not be removed or altered. A description and list of all symbols
reserved for manual chart updates is contained in <<annexA>>
. **Archiving of Manual Updates**. It should be possible to remove
from the display any manual update. The removed update should be retained
in the ECDIS for future review until commencement of the next voyage,
but will not be otherwise displayed.

==== Additional Mariner's Information

Mariner's Caution Notes and a Mariner's Information Notes must be
presented according to IEC 61174 or IEC 62288, as applicable [and
available].

Point cautions and notes entered by the mariner and the manufacturer
must be distinguished by the colours orange and yellow respectively.

==== Automatic Updates

Only ISO8211 and GML encoded data can support updates, as described
in S-100 Part 10a and 10b respectively. The use of GML updates as
described in S-100 Part 10b is used, in particular, by S-128 to update
catalogue information used by the ECDIS to produce update Status Reports,
as described in <<annexC>> - ECDIS Update Status Reports.

==== Identifying automatic chart corrections on demand

On Mariner demand automatic chart corrections of ENC information must
be highlighted as described in the following sub-clauses.

===== Added Feature (automatic)

Point object: Superimpose symbol CHRVID01.

Curve object: Overwrite with line style CHRVID02.

Surface object: Overwrite area boundary with line style CHRVID02 and
superimpose symbol CHRVID01 on any centred symbol.

===== Deleted Feature (automatic)

Point object: Superimpose symbol CHRVDEL1.

Curve object: Overwrite with line style CHRVDEL2 (do not remove the
original line).

Surface object: Overwrite area boundary with line style CHRVDEL2 and
superimpose symbol CHRVDEL1 on any centred symbol.

===== Modified Feature (automatic)

Point: Superimpose symbol CHRVID01 and symbol CHRVDEL1.

Curve: Overwrite with line styles CHRVID02 and CHRVDEL2.

Surface: Overwrite the boundary with line styles CHRVID02 and CHRVDEL2
and also superimpose symbols CHRVID01 and CHRVDEL1 on any centred
symbol.

==== Update Information

The S-101 Feature Catalogue also provides encoders with an
*Update Information* feature that is used to represent a change to
the information shown.

The intention of the *Update Information* feature is to show the extent
of changes contained in either updates or new editions of S-101 datasets.
This is separate to the highlighting mechanism described in the previous
clause and is optionally included by data producers in ENCs.

For example, when an ENC update contains updates to various features
that adjoin a feature that was actually update, the producer will
use an *Update Information* feature to indicate the actual feature
that was affected and a brief description of the changes.

The 'Update Review' IMS must be implemented to allow update information
features to be portrayed and reviewed on demand.

==== Non-official (Non-ENC) Chart Information

Non-official data added to existing official ENC data to augment the
chart information must be distinguished from the official information
as follows:

Point feature: Superimpose symbol CHCRID01.

Curve feature: Overwrite with line style CHCRID01.

Surface feature: Overwrite area boundary with line style CHCRID01
and superimpose symbol CHCRID01 on any centred symbol.

Non-official data must be distinguished from manually updated chart
information, which uses the same identifiers, by cursor picking.

Non-official chart information may be updated by any systematic procedure.
A record of updates must be maintained.

The mariner must be able to remove all non-official chart information
if the need should arise.

[[sec_12.12]]
=== Display and Management of Navigational Warnings

S-124 Navigational Warnings (NAVWARN) portrayal is provided by a portrayal
catalogue that includes a symbol set and symbol instructions for the
feature and attribute combinations.

[[sec_12.12.1]]
==== Additional Portrayal requirements of the Graphical User Interface

A dedicated interface must be provided to allow users to interact
with NAVWARN messages. This interface must, at a minimum, provide
the following functionality;

. The user must be able to tag individual messages according to the
filtering requirements in <<sec_12.12.2>>
. A Capability for an on demand listing of all (S-124) NAVWARN messages
in the system, and sorting these according to: received date and time,
issue date and time, warning type, producer and series, must be provided.
Additionally, a means to list according to user classification should
be provided.
. Provide an indication when a new NAVWARN message is received until
it has been displayed or 24 hours have passed. This indication may
be suppressed if the NAVWARN message does not meet filtering criteria
set by the mariner (see <<sec_12.12.2>>).
. Means must be provided for the mariner to enter criteria for filtering
of indication of new NAVWARN messages based on time and maximum distance
from own ship, monitored route or planned route (see <<sec_12.12.2>>).
Default setting must be no filtering.
. Details of the filtering options that have been enabled by user
must be available on demand for inspection and modification.
. Means must be provided to view the most recent message, past messages,
and to view messages associated with selection of NAVWARN symbols
in the graphical display area.
. Listing of all NAVWARN must include means for viewing an abbreviated
view of any **NAVWARNPart**, *warningInformation* attributes present.

NOTE: It may be possible to create some of this functionality via
portrayal context parameters,

[[sec_12.12.2]]
==== Filtering Navigational Warning information

The mariner must be able to select the graphical display of S-124
navigational warning (NAVWARN) dataset on or off.

To ensure only relevant information is displayed, and to ensure an
uncluttered screen, the mariner must be able to filter the NAVWARNs
as follows :

At a minimum, filtering functionality must be included that allows
the user to classify the relevance of a NAVWARN against the intended
route as:

* on chart (relevant for the route, must always be visualized), or;
* off chart (not relevant for the route, and need not be visualized),
or;
* information (relevant for the route, but for information and need
not be visualized).

On chart should be the default classification for all NAVWARNs.

NOTE: Even though the full extent of a navigational warning may not
be portrayed, it must still be available and discoverable in a list
of NAVWARNs that can be recalled by user action at any time

Additional filtering functions may include options such as;

* Filtering on route with a buffer;
* Navigational warning topic;
* Date range of the hazard;
* Valid time of the navigational warning.

These filters may then be used to assist the navigator in classifying
a NAVWARN according to its relevance for the route.

====
A self-cancelling dataset:

*NAVWARNPreamble* +
*publicationTime* of 20230704T010000Z +
*cancellationDate* of 20230711T000000Z +
*NAVWARNPart fixedDateRange* of 20230706T010000Z to 20230710T010000Z

is visible on navigation screen during 20230706T010000Z to 20230710T010000Z,
unless removed by a filter set by user, and optionally visible during
20230704T010000Z to 20230706T005959Z.
====

NOTE: It must be possible for user to recall cancelled messages for
review purposes.

[example]
Any dangers that are in waters too shallow for the ship get classified
as off chart warnings, _but must be discoverable_ in the on demand
listing of active NAVWARNs.

[[sec_12.12.3]]
==== Cancelled datasets

When a S-124 dataset is cancelled it must not be displayed on the
navigation screen, but must be available for review in the on demand
listing of NAVWARNs in the navigation system and marked as cancelled.

[[sec_12.12.4]]
==== Portrayal of feature types

The *NAVWARNAreaAffected* class does not have a portrayal defined
to avoid causing significant cluttering on the navigation screen.
Rather, the feature must be highlighted by the system if selected
from a pick report or by other means for interrogation by user.

When a *NAVWARNPart* is not portrayed, such as when user selections
mark it not to be visualized, any associated *TextPlacement* features
must also not be portrayed.
