== Specifications for the display screen

=== Physical display requirements

The requirements for the main graphic display are:

Size:: Minimum effective size of the area for chart display:
stem:[270 xx 270 "unitsml(mm)"] (IMO MSC 530(106) 10.2).

Resolution:: Minimum lines per mm (stem:[L]) given by stem:[L = 864/s],
where stem:[s] is the smaller dimension of the chart display area.
(e.g. for the minimum chart area, stem:[s = 270 "unitsml(mm)"], the
resolution stem:[L = 864//270 = 3.20] lines per mm, giving a
"picture unit" size of stem:[0.312 "unitsml(mm)"])

The specifications above permit a chart display whose minimum resolution
(lines/mm) may vary depending on the size of the display. Maintaining
a clearly readable chart display under this flexibility imposes certain
requirements on the display software, which are described in <<sec_10.2>>.

Information should be displayed in the ECDIS on one or more physical
screens, which may be divided into more than one chart display.
Information may be displayed automatically, on demand or as a result
of Mariner's selection.

The physical size of the screen(s) should be appropriate to viewing
conditions. Larger screens may be more suitable for situations where
the operational viewing distance is higher, because the larger physical
area of the display offsets the reduction of on-screen geographical
extent that is caused by the greater zoom levels and symbol sizes
necessitated by greater viewing distances.

Redraw during route monitoring to follow the ship's progress, including
scale changes due to change in the scale of the chart information,
should take less than 5 seconds. Demands by the Mariner that cannot
be predicted by the ECDIS, such as draw at a different scale or in
a different area may take more than 5 seconds. In the latter case:

* The Mariner should be informed;
* The display should continue route monitoring

=== Colour reproduction

Absolute accuracy in colour reproduction is not required but relative
colour fidelity is important. To ensure clear contrast between colour-coded
features the display screen must be calibrated before use, and this
calibration should as far as possible be maintained while in service.
If this is not done, lines, symbols, and area shades may become indistinct,
and information may then be lost or become misleading.

=== Display requirements for colours

[[sec_19.3]]
==== General

The ECDIS manufacturer can use any technology to build the display
as long as their display fulfils the requirements of this specification.

==== Display calibration and verification

The ECDIS display must be calibrated initially in order to transform
the CIE colour table coordinates to screen coordinates. The main components
of the ECDIS display are the monitor and the image generator.
Both the monitor and the image generator used to drive the ECDIS display
can be calibrated together as a colour generating unit. Another alternative
is to calibrate separately both the monitor and image generator.

The following international standards describe methods for calibration
of a monitor's RGB values to produce an output. Other methodologies
may be followed, but the same verification test requirements apply
regardless of method.

CIE 122-1996 _Technical Report: The Relationship between Digital and
Colorimetric Data for Computer-Controlled CRT Displays._

IEC 61966-3:2000 __Multimedia systems and equipment -Colour measurement
and management - Part 3: Equipment using cathode ray tubes__,
Edition 1.

IEC 61966-4:2000 __Multimedia systems and equipment-Colour measurement
and management - Part 4: Equipment using liquid crystal display panels__,
Edition 1.

The ECDIS display calibration must be verified for type approval of
all monitors.

==== Colour control, contrast and brightness controls

There are a variety of technologies available for monitors to be used
for ECDIS display. Different technologies have different methods to
control colour, contrast and brightness, but some basic rules apply
for all of them.

==== Effect of controls

The contrast control of a display generally shortens or extends the
range of luminance available, making the display appear darker or
brighter.

On the other hand, the brightness control shortens or extends the
range of colour saturation available by adding white
(which extends the range by making colours other than black less saturated),
or subtracting white (colours become darker, more saturated.)

To the viewer, it has much the same apparent effect as contrast, but
it achieves this by altering the colour contrast of the colour tables
between foreground and background colours, and this may result in
some features becoming harder to see, particularly at night.
More importantly, making the night display more saturated may drop
some dark colours below the cut-off point, into black, thus losing
distinctions such as shallow versus deep water.

==== Use of the controls

Colour tables are provided for day, dusk and night. The mariner must
be provided with the control to make fine adjustments between these
tables; the calibration position must be marked as a reference for
this.

The general principle is that all colour calibration controls must
have a provision to return to the calibrated settings.

The ECDIS manual must carry a warning that use of the ECDIS with uncalibrated
settings may adversely affect the visibility of information on the
display.

==== Setting the controls for route monitoring

The ECDIS display carries far more detail than a radar display, and
requires correspondingly more attention to the correct selection of
colour table and the correct adjustment of the controls.

This particularly affects the black-background displays, and is critically
important at night, because all colours of the night table, particularly
those for large areas, have to be set very dark to avoid loss of night
vision, and if the control is turned down too far these colours will
disappear into the black background. As a result, chart information
will be lost.

The situation will be worse if one of the day tables is improperly
dimmed for use at night, instead of switching to the night table.

It is important that the display be adapted to lighting conditions
on the bridge by selecting the correct colour table: "Day" for bright
sunlight; "Day" or "Dusk" for general daylight viewing; "Dusk" for
twilight; and "Night" for the night-darkened bridge.

The controls should only be used for fine adjustment within the appropriate
colour table.

To ensure that the controls are always set to a level above that at
which information will be lost, the black-adjust symbol BLKADJ must
be available to the Mariner, treated as "Standard display", to be
called up at any convenient point on the screen. The instructions
for its use by the Mariner must be incorporated in the ECDIS manual.

The following text box contains an example of instruction for an LCD
type of Monitor. The LCD type of monitor used in this example has
only one mariner control, called "brilliance". Internally the monitor
has also other controls available for service engineers. These internal
controls include also controls named as contrast and brightness.

____
First, set brilliance to calibration position. Look at the black-adjust
symbol.
Then either:

* If the centre square is not visible, turn up the brilliance until
it just appears;

or

* If the centre square is clearly visible, turn down the brilliance
until the inner square disappears, then turn brilliance back up until
the inner square is just visible again.

(If the above adjustment is not successful, select a more appropriate
colour table and repeat this procedure.)

The "black level" is now correctly set. If a brighter display is required
use the brilliance control, but it is better not to re-adjust the
controls unless lighting conditions on the bridge change.Note that
the black-adjust symbol should be displayed to check that the inner
square remains visible on the following occasions:

* Every time that the brightness or contrast controls are adjusted.
* Every time that the display is switched to the night colour table.
____

=== Colour display capability

Colour displays must be capable of at least 256 luminance steps in
each of red, green and blue.

==== Colour conversion tolerances and tests

===== Tolerances

The tolerances quoted below apply only to the process of converting
CIE colour coordinates to RGB values

Considerable operational experience will be needed before it will
be possible to state colour maintenance tolerances for ECDIS on-board
ship.

The colour tables developed have been selected to ensure maximum colour
discrimination between features. Colour discrimination depends on
both the colour difference and the luminance difference between two
colours. Colour science (as represented by the CIE colour convention)
has defined colour difference units stem:[Delta E^**].
The stem:[Delta E^**] metric is a measure of the overall discrimination
(including both colour and luminance differences). As a metric for
ECDIS colour accuracy, a measure of the discrimination in colour alone,
excluding luminance differences has been defined as a subset of
stem:[Delta E^**] referred to as stem:[Delta (u^**,v^**)].

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
Delta(u^**,v^**) = SQRT[(u2^** - u1^**)^2 + (v2^** - v1^**)^2]
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
Delta E^** = SQRT [(L2^** - L1^**)^2 + (u2^** - u1^**)^2 + (v2^** - v1^**)^2]
++++

Calculations of stem:[L^**, u^**], and stem:[v^**] must be made using
as reference the chromaticity and luminance specified for the brightest
white colour token in the respective colour table stem:[(Y0, u0, y0)];
where stem:[Y0] is the luminance in units of stem:["unitsml(cd/m^2)"].
Note: this is not the brightest white of the monitor.

NOTE: "stem:[Delta]" represents the Greek letter "Delta", although
it may appear differently on some computers.

The tolerances for the conversion of the colour tables from the CIE
colours defined in these specifications to the actual RGB values for
the ECDIS display are defined in three terms:

. Overall discrimination between actual colours within the converted
table: stem:[Delta E^**]. This is to ensure that all the colours within
the RGB table remain discriminably separate; that is, that the relative
colour distinctions have been maintained.

. Colour discrimination differences between the defined and the actual
values: stem:[Delta (u^**,v^**)]. This is to ensure that the actual
RGB colours resulting from the conversion remain reasonably close
to the CIE colours defined in the specifications; that is, that the
blues stay blue and the greens stay green.

. Luminance differences between the defined values and the actual
values: stem:[L]. This is to ensure that the luminance remains the
same within acceptable limits.

Note: The CIE stem:[L^** u^** v^**] human perception colour model,
which is the source of the tolerances described above, has not yet
been evaluated at the low luminances of the night colour table, at
which the less colour-sensitive rods of the eye take over from the
daytime cones. Consequently these tolerances should not be applied
to the night table; and for type-approval purposes they are restricted
to the bright sun table.

Colour tolerance values:

. The discrimination difference between any two colours displayed
(except those listed with a tabular stem:[Delta E^**] less than 20)
must be not less than stem:[10 Delta E^**] units.

[[table_7]]
.Tolerance exceptions
[cols="47,93,49,93,22"]
|===
h| Token h| Colour stem:[(x, y, L)] h| Token h| Colour stem:[(x, y, L)] h| stem:[Delta E^**]

| DEPMD | (.27 .30 65)pale blue   | CHWHTDEPDWUIBCK | (.28 .31 80)white       | 11
| CHBRN | (.42 .45 30)brown       | ADINF           | (.41, .47 35)yellow     | 14
| DEPMS | (.24 .26 55)medium blue | DEPVSUIAFD      | (.22 .24 45)medium blue | 17
| DEPMD | (.27 .30 65)pale blue   | CHGRFNODTA      | (.28 .31 45)faint grey  | 18
|===

. The difference between the colour displayed and the CIE colour defined
in these specifications must be not greater than 16 stem:[Delta(u^**,v^**)]
units. If a monitor is independently tested, then the difference must
not be greater than stem:[8 Delta(u^**,v^**)] units.

. The luminance of the colour displayed must be within 20% of its
specified value. Black is a special case and the luminance of it must
not be greater than stem:[0.52 "unitsml(cd/m^2)"] for bright sun colour
table.

===== Instrumental calibration verification test

For LCD displays, an instrumental test to check that the results of
the colour conversion calibration are within tolerance should be
made by

. Displaying the colours of all three colour tables (restricted to
colour pairs of tabular stem:[Delta E^**] greater than 20)
. Measuring their CIE coordinates stem:[x],stem:[y] and stem:[L]
. Applying a tolerance test.

Note that since the tolerance test is intended solely to check successful
colour calibration, and not to test colour maintenance at sea, this
test should be performed on the bench in the manufacturer's or type-approval
authority's plant under normal conditions of temperature, humidity
and vibration.

Manufacturers of ECDIS can choose between two different methods of
colour calibration.

The first method is a test of a monitor as part of an integrated system.
In this method both the monitor and the image generator parts of ECDIS
display are tested together.

The second method is an independent test of the monitor. In this method
the monitor and the image generator of ECDIS display are separately
tested against a reference (that is, the monitor is tested against
a reference image generator and the image generator is tested against
a reference monitor). The second method has tighter tolerance for
displayed colour than the first method.

=== ECDIS Chart 1 and Colour (Differentiation) Test Diagram

The IHO provides ECDIS Chart 1 in digital form, a graphical index
of selected ECDIS symbols and symbolized lines and area boundary linestyles.
This is intended to familiarize the Mariner with the colour and symbol
coding used by the ECDIS. The symbols are grouped according to INT1,
which is familiar to the Mariner, but are numbered with a look-up
sheet, not labelled.

Since Product Specifications for data products used on ECDIS will
be updated at different times, there may be a supplementary
"Chart 1" for each data product other than ENC that is intended for
use in ECDIS.

The ECDIS Chart 1 and any supplements are intended for use in route
planning. They are not needed during route monitoring, when the Mariner
can use cursor enquiry to find the meaning of symbols.

The ECDIS Chart 1 and its indexing list of symbol names and meanings
arranged numerically, together with the colour differentiation test
diagrams, are intended for the Mariner's use. The use of the Colour
Differentiation Test Diagrams is described in <<sec_19.6.2>>

[[sec_19.6]]
=== Use of ECDIS Chart 1 and Colour Test Diagram

==== Specification for ECDIS Chart 1 and the Colour Test Diagram

===== Definition

Each Chart 1 dataset must be initially displayed at the optimumDisplayScale,
so as to fill all of the standard ECDIS display area (that is,
the minimum stem:[270 xx 270 "unitsml(mm)"] chart area).

===== Description and purpose

The ECDIS Chart 1 and the Colour Differentiation Test are for use
by the Mariner and are provided in the form of an Exchange Set containing
a number of S-100 datasets.

The ECDIS chart 1 is intended to familiarise the Mariner with the
symbology used on ECDIS. The Mariner must be able to display each
cell, and by cursor-pick get a read-out of the meaning of any
feature shown.

The Colour Differentiation Test diagram is intended for display using
the day or dusk colour tables so that the Mariner can check that the
ECDIS display is providing adequate colour performance It is also
used in type-approval testing. Instructions for its use are given
in the following clauses.

The ECDIS Chart 1 includes the CHKSYM symbol which is intended for
checking the correct size of the symbols during the type approval.
The width and height of the CHKSYM is stem:[5.0 "unitsml(mm)"].

The line width of the diagonal lines in the Colour Differentiation
Test diagram are specified as stem:[0.6 "unitsml(mm)"] wide.

===== Mode of use

The operation of these diagrams is not subject to any draw-speed requirements
of route monitoring.

===== Content and Encoding

Chart 1 is released as an exchange set comprising a number of S-100
datasets within the S-164 suite of test data. Portrayal and content
are defined wholly by feature and portrayal catalogues.

===== Revisions

Revisions will be made by whole file replacement; that is, by the
issuing of new editions. The user must be able to access the revision
information of Chart 1 and the Colour Test Diagram.

===== Presentation and parameter settings

Refer to the S-164 test dataset manual for ECDIS parameter settings
for portrayal of Chart 1 datasets.

[[sec_19.6.2]]
==== The Colour Test Diagram

A multi-purpose colour differentiation test diagram is illustrated
in <<fig_4>>. This consists of 20 squares each coloured with one of
the 4 main background colour fills (such as shallow water blue);
and each having a diagonal line in one of the six important foreground
colours (such as mariner's orange). Each diagonal line is
stem:[0.64 "unitsml(mm)"].

The diagram is in the form of a dataset and so can be displayed using
any of the three colour palettes. This diagram is intended:

. For use by the Mariner to check and if necessary re-adjust the controls,
particularly for use at night;
. For use by the Mariner to verify that an ageing display remains
capable of providing the necessary colour differentiation; and
. For initial colour verification of the day, dusk and night colour
tables.

Both the Colour Test Diagram and the instructions for its use are
included within the IHO S-164 test datasets Chart 1 exchange set,
and must be made available to the Mariner. In addition, a grey scale
is included in <<sec_19.6>> for use by maintenance technicians in
checking colour tracking in an ageing display.

The Colour Differentiation Test diagram is not needed during route
monitoring.

Note that the Colour Differentiation Test Diagram will not be true
to colour unless it is projected on a calibrated screen and is generated
using the digital format provided by IHO, which correctly reproduces
the colour tokens of the Presentation Library.

The colour differentiation diagram is required in "Day" and "Dusk"
colours so that the Mariner can verify that the ECDIS display monitor
has the colour differentiation capability needed to distinguish between
the various colour-coded areas, lines and point symbols of the ECDIS
display.

NOTE: For illustrative purposes only. Actual ECDIS Chart 1 datasets
must be used

[discrete]
===== Providing the diagram

The Colour Differentiation Test diagram must be provided to enable
the Mariner to verify that the display screen still retains the colour
differentiation capability needed to distinguish between the various
colour-coded areas, lines and point symbols of the ECDIS display.

The diagram will not be true to colour unless it is displayed on a
calibrated monitor and is generated using the provided ENC portrayal
catalogue.

To provide the diagram the dataset labelled "10100AACH1WOO" must be
used. This dataset must be initially displayed at the optimumDisplayScale
so that the extent of the imaginary chart data covers the entire ECDIS
display.

The diagram consists of twenty numbered squares extending over the
whole of a stem:[270 xx 270 "unitsml(mm)"] screen Each square is coloured
with one of the four main background area shades (such as shallow
water blue, DEPVS), and each carries a two-pixel wide diagonal line
in one of the important line or symbol foreground colours. These are
arranged as follows:

*Four main background colours:*

[cols="3,10,5",options="noheader,unnumbered",frame=none,grid=none]
|===
| DEPVS | (shallow water blue)          | squares 3, 5, 11, 15, 18, 20.
| DEPDW | (deep water, white or black)  | squares 1, 7, 8, 10, 13, 19.
| LANDA | (land colour)                 | squares 6, 14, 17.
| NODTA
| (no data shade: radar, navigation safety
lines and chartwork must be visible on the
no-data part of a display)
| squares 2, 4, 9, 12, 16.
|===

*Six important foreground colours:*

[cols="3,10,5",options="noheader,unnumbered",frame=none,grid=none]
|===
| DEPSC | (safety contour grey)                         | squares 3, 10, 17.
| NINFO | (orange, Mariner's information)               | squares 5, 8, 14, 16.
| ADINF | (yellow, manufacturer's information)          | squares 12, 15, 19.
| TRFCD | (magenta, traffic lanes and area boundaries)  | squares 1, 9, 11.
| RADLO | (the lower luminance radar green)             | squares 4, 6, 13, 18.
| RESBL
| (blue, provisionally reserved for traffic info from transponder, VTS etc.)
| squares 2, 7, 20.
|===

The procedures for carrying out the test are documented in S-164.

==== Relationship to S-57 Chart 1

The Chart 1 datasets are located alongside the existing S-57
Chart 1 cells to allow use of both in Dual Fuel mode.

==== The Black-adjust symbol

The black-adjust symbol BLKADJ01 is to allow the Mariner to adjust
the display for ambient illumination on the bridge of a ship. An ECDIS
must have the black-adjust symbol displayed whenever the mariner is
adjusting the display (that is, depending on the technology of the
display brilliance, brightness, contrast, etc), as required by <<sec_19.3>>.
