[[sec_A-1]]
== Introduction

S-98 Part A contains information that applies to Interoperability
Catalogues which use interoperability rules and operations of at most
Level 1 interoperability.

Interoperability Catalogues conforming to this Part must comply with
both the following components of S-98:

. S-98 Main Specification, which describes requirements applying to
all S-98 Interoperability Catalogues and S-98 Exchange Sets;
. S-98 Part A (this Part), which defines the subset of the interoperability
model and Catalogue encoding that are specific to Level 1 interoperability.

The hypothetical processing model for implementations is described
in general terms in the "S-98 - Main" document and elaborated in <<sec_A-7>>
of this Part.

In Level 1 processing, feature types from different products, including
S-101, are interleaved as specified by display plane and drawing priority
information contained in the Interoperability Catalogue. The ENC is
still treated as the main product, but feature layers from other products
may be interleaved with ENC feature layers to prevent ENC data from
being obscured. There is no other interoperability-related processing
of feature data at this level.

The output of interoperability processing is either the original feature
data (processing option 1) or drawing instructions
(processing option 2), accompanied by display plane and drawing priority
information, which is passed through to the portrayal processor. <<sec_A-7>>
elaborates on these options.

[[sec_A-1.1]]
=== How to read this Part

<<sec_A-2>> of this Part contains scope identification information
corresponding to the contents of this Part, which applies specifically
to Interoperability Catalogues designated as Level 1.

For <<sec_A-3;to!sec_A-10>>, the content of the clause or sub-clause
extends or elaborates on the content under the same or similar clause
heading or sub-heading in the S-98 - Main document.

The numbering of <<sec_A-3;to!sec_A-10>> may differ from that of corresponding
clauses in S-98 - Main, because for some there is no additional Level-specific
information needed. If a clause or sub-clause in S-98 - Main has no
corresponding clause or sub-clause in this Part, there is no Level-specific
information on that topic.

[[sec_A-2]]
== Specification Scope for Part A

S-98 Part A describes the portions of S-98 which correspond to the
following scope defined in S-98 - Main (clause 2):

*Scope Identification:* S98L1

*Level*: MD_ScopeCode - 13 (software)

*Level Name*: Interoperability Level 1

*Description*: Interleaving of feature types

*Extent*: EX_Extent.description = "worldwide";
EX_GeographicBoundingBox = [-180, +180, -90, +90]

[[sec_A-3]]
== Data Content and Structure

=== Application Schema

[[sec_A-3.1.1]]
==== Overview of Application Schema

The Application Schema for Interoperability Level 1 is depicted in
<<fig_A-3.1>> below. This Application Schema is a subset of the full
Application Schema in S-100 Part 16. It consists of the following
components:

. Catalogue header information.
. Display plane ordering information.
. Display plane content in the form of either features or drawing
instructions.

[[fig_A-3.1]]
.Level 1 Interoperability Catalogue
image::figure-a-3-1.png[]

[[sec_A-3.1.2]]
==== Operations in pre-defined combinations

Operations in predefined combinations are possible only in Levels
2, 3, and 4 (Parts B, C, D).

[[sec_A-3.1.3]]
==== Enhanced selection of feature instances

Enhanced selection of feature instances is possible only in Levels
3 and 4 (Parts C and D).

[[sec_A-3.1.4]]
==== Interoperability Levels

The _interoperabilityLevel_ attribute in *S100_IC_InteroperabilityCatalogue*
specifies the highest level of interoperability implemented in that
XML Interoperability Catalogue file. The _interoperabilityLevel_ attribute
in *S100_IC_DisplayPlane* specifies the level to which that display
plane pertains.

[[sec_A-3.1.5]]
==== Hybridization rules

Hybridization rules are allowed only in Levels 3 and 4
(Parts C and D).

[[sec_A-3.1.6]]
==== Hybrid Feature and Portrayal Catalogues

Hybrid Feature and Portrayal Catalogues are allowed only in Levels
3 and 4 (Parts C and D).

[[sec_A-3.1.7]]
==== Progression of Interoperability Levels

The only progression of Interoperability Levels is from no interoperability
(in which case Interoperability Catalogues are not involved and there
is no interoperability Schema) to Level 1 interoperability.

=== Interoperability Catalogue

[[sec_A-3.2.1]]
==== Conceptual types for Level 1 interoperability

The following clauses summarize the conceptual elements used in Level
1 Interoperability Catalogues. Details about these conceptual types
are provided in S-100 Part 16.

[[sec_A-3.2.1.1]]
===== Display plane (S100_IC_DisplayPlane)

A display plane element in the Interoperability Catalogue acts as
a container for display information for specified feature classes,
which enables the interleaving of feature layers during portrayal
by indicating the display plane, priority, and drawing order of the
features assigned to a display plane.

A feature type may be referenced in more than one **S100_IC_DisplayPlane**,
but the entries in different display planes must be distinguished
by different attribute-value combinations or spatial primitives so
that the actual instances of features are partitioned unambiguously
between different display planes.

The portrayal of feature types not mentioned in any *S100_IC_DisplayPlane*
component is undefined until ordinary portrayal processing takes place.

[[sec_A-3.2.1.2]]
===== Feature type display information (S100_IC_Feature)

The *S100_IC_Feature* element describes the display parameters for
all features of a specific feature type in a specific product and
thereby determines the order of drawing the feature type relative
to other feature types in the same display plane. It also specifies
the viewing group to which the feature is assigned. Its applicability
can be optionally restricted to a subset of instances of the feature
type by additional attributes that specify the type of spatial primitive
and indicate specific values of thematic attributes.

[[sec_A-3.2.1.3]]
===== Drawing instruction (S100_IC_DrawingInstruction)

Drawing instructions in the Interoperability Catalogue play a similar
role to feature type display information (*S100_IC_FeatureType*) but
with drawing instructions instead of feature objects. The
*S100_IC_DrawingInstruction* element in Interoperability Catalogues
is similar in operation to the layering and priority aspects of the
*DrawingInstruction* element in Portrayal Catalogues
(see S-100 Part 9 - Portrayal). Where there is a conflict with a Portrayal
Catalogue drawing instruction, the drawing instruction in the Interoperability
Catalogue supersedes the drawing instruction in the Portrayal Catalogue.

The *S100_IC_DrawingInstruction* element contains an additional attribute
that allows substitution of symbolization instructions generated by
portrayal processing.

[[sec_A-3.2.1.3.1]]
====== Comparison and use of S100_IC_Feature and S100_IC_DrawingInstruction

*S100_IC_Feature* and *S100_IC_DrawingInstruction* elements in Interoperability
Catalogues operate in essentially the same way as far as assignment
of drawing order, priority, and display planes is concerned. They
differ in that *S100_IC_DrawingInstruction* provides an optional attribute
to substitute the symbolization elements of the drawing instruction.

*S100_IC_Feature* should be used for Interoperability Catalogues that
are designed for systems where interoperability processing precedes
the generation of drawing instructions.

*S100_IC_DrawingInstruction* should be used for Interoperability Catalogues
that are designed for systems where interoperability processing precedes
the generation of drawing instructions. It should also be used in
all Catalogues where substitution of symbolization is necessary.

[[sec_A-3.2.2]]
==== Use of S-100 types

The S-100 types used by S-98 Level 1 Interoperability Catalogues are
described in the S-98 - Main document. For Level 1 Interoperability
Catalogues, the following additional information applies.

* Interoperability Catalogues of Level 1 do not use feature and information
associations in feature filters.

=== UML model documentation

The UML model documentation is provided in S-100 Part 16. This clause
documents details specific to the use of the UML model for the interoperability
Level described in this Part of S-98.

Only the model elements used in this Level (and included in the Level's
Application Schema) are listed. The constraints and considerations
listed in the UML documentation tables in S-100 Part 16 apply. Any
S-98 general or Level-specific considerations are described under
the element name in the list below.

. *S100_IC_DisplayPlane*: No Level-specific constraints or notes.
+
--
*Attribute* __interoperabilityLevel__: Mandatory in S-98 Catalogues
at all levels. The only value allowed for Level 1 Interoperability
Catalogues is 1.
--

. *S100_IC_DrawingInstruction*:
+
--
NOTE: for implementers: Even if the Presentation Schema in S-100 Part
9 is used, implementers may need to provide specific code to validate
the content of the _substituteSymbolization_ attribute instead of
depending on normal XML Schema validation. The content of this attribute
is not prescribed by this Specification and may be a fragment of XML,
or interpretable code or rules, etc, in a non-XML syntax. It may be
enclosed in a `<![CDATA[…]]>` section so that XML validators treat it
as character data instead of XML.
--

. *S100_IC_Feature*: No Level-specific constraints or notes.
. *S100_IC_InteroperabilityCatalogue*:
+
--
*Attribute* __productCovered__: Must use values defined in the dictionary
identified by MRN: urn:mrn:iho:prod:s98:1:0:0:products.

*Attribute* __interoperabilityLevel__: Mandatory. The only value allowed
for level 1 Interoperability Catalogues is 1.
--

. *Codelist dataProduct*: No Level-specific constraints or notes.
The data type for all Levels is described below.
+
--
Codelist Type: closed dictionary

MRN: urn:mrn:iho:prod:s98:1:0:0:products.
--

. *Codelist requirementType*: No Level-specific constraints or notes.

For all interoperability Levels, the following subset of the standard
values listed in S-100 Part 16 are permitted to be used in S-98 Interoperability
Catalogues:

[[sec_A-4]]
== Level-Specific Data Quality Considerations

[[sec_A-4.1]]
=== Quality of displayed data

There are no Level-specific extensions to clause 6.1 of the
"S98 - Main" document.

<<sec_A-5.11>> provides guidance for maintaining data quality for
Level-specific rules and operations.

[[sec_A-4.2]]
=== Quality of interoperability catalogues

The quality measures recommended in S-97 (Part C) which are applicable
to Level 1 S-98 Interoperability Catalogues are those listed in
Table 6-1 of the "S-98 - Main" document. There are no additional Level-specific
measures for Level 1.

[[sec_A-4.2.1]]
==== Test methods

There are no Level-specific extensions to clause 6.2.1 of the
"S-98 - Main" document.

[[sec_A-4.2.2]]
==== Data quality testing

There are no Level-specific extensions to clause 6.2.2 of the
"S-98 - Main" document.

[[sec_A-5]]
== Level-Specific Guidance on Making Product Specifications Interoperable

The guidelines in this clause supplement and extend guidance common
to all Levels on making Product Specifications interoperable, which
is given in clause 8 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

=== Duplicated features

There is no Level-specific guidance for determining duplicated features.
However, when Interoperability Catalogues are developed to resolve
duplicated features, keep in mind the following Level-dependent considerations:

* Level 1 Interoperability Catalogues can allow only changes to the
display planes and display orders specified in the products' Portrayal
Catalogues, as determined by display plane and drawing priority information.
This means that features which are not covered by features with higher
drawing priority or in an upper display plane will still be visible.

[[sec_A-5.1.1]]
==== Duplicated features same model

See the guidance in clause 8.1.1 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

[[sec_A-5.1.2]]
==== Duplicated features, different models

See the guidance in clause 8.1.2 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

[[sec_A-5.1.3]]
==== Duplicate feature domains

See the guidance in clause 8.1.3 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

=== Geometry

[[sec_A-5.2.1]]
==== Combined geometry

Combined geometry is possible only in Interoperability
Levels 3 and 4 (Parts C and D of this Specification).

[[sec_A-5.2.2]]
==== Spatial discrepancy, unrelated to scaled or cartographic smoothing

Resolution of this type of spatial discrepancy is possible only in
Levels, 2, 3, and 4 (Parts B, C, and D of this Specification).

There is no Level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 8.2.2 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

[[sec_A-5.2.3]]
==== Spatial discrepancies, related to scale or cartographic smoothing

Resolution of this type of spatial discrepancy is possible only in
Levels, 2, 3, and 4 (Parts B, C, and D of this specification).

There is no level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 8.2.3 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

=== Display of text

There is no Level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 10.8 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

=== Skin-of-the-earth feature operations

[[sec_A-5.4.1]]
==== Skin-of-the earth feature replacement

Level 1 Interoperability Catalogues permit the following:

* Interleaving of display planes so that upper planes overwrite lower
planes (Level 1 functionality). This can be used to shift feature
layers to lower or higher planes to overwrite layers whose replacement
is desired.

See <<sec_A-6.9>> for portrayal considerations.

[[sec_A-5.4.2]]
==== Skin-of-the earth feature adjusting

Adjustment of the geometry of skin-of-the-earth features is possible
only in Level 4 (Part D).

[[sec_A-5.5]]
=== Blended feature concepts

Blended features or blended portrayal are only possible in interoperability
Levels 3 and 4 (Parts C and D).

=== Hierarchy of data

[[sec_A-5.6.1]]
==== Hierarchy by stacking of display planes

In Level 1 Interoperability Catalogues, hierarchy can be set only
to the extent that display planes can be interleaved by the interoperability
rules.

[[sec_A-5.6.2]]
==== Predefined combinations

Predefined combinations can be defined only in Level 2, 3, or 4 Interoperability
Catalogues (Parts B, C, and D).

[[sec_A-5.7]]
=== New datasets

There is no Level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 8.7 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

[[sec_A-5.8]]
=== Dataset scales, loading, and unloading

There is no Level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 8.8 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

[[sec_A-5.9]]
=== Metadata

There is no Level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 8.9 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

[[sec_A-5.10]]
=== Meta-features

Any spatial operations on meta-features require an Interoperability
Catalogue to implement at least Level 4.

There is no other Level-specific guidance for meta-features. Common
guidance is provided in clause 8.10 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

[[sec_A-5.11]]
=== Quality considerations

There is no Level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 8.11 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

== Portrayal

This clause provides guidelines and instruction to portrayal considerations
related to the use of the Interoperability Catalogue in an ECDIS.
The Interoperability Catalogue must apply to the specific Product
Specifications listed in the Interoperability Catalogue metadata,
_interoperabilityCatalogueProducts_ attribute under *S100_IC_CatalogueMetadata*.

There may be additional data products present in the S-100 ECDIS that
are external to the Interoperability Catalogue; in such cases the
Interoperability Catalogue should continue to function in the presence
of products not defined in the Catalogue. Data products that are outside
of the interoperability scope must be treated in Interoperability
Level 0 (see clause 9.6 of the "S-98 - Main" document).

=== Display of significant features

There is no Level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 10.1 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

=== Display of significant features - switching to original

There is no Level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 10.2 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

=== Portrayal distinguishability - colour set-asides

There is no Level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 10.3 of the "S-98 - Main" document. See also
S-100 Part 16 for specific guidance on colour set-asides.

=== Day/night/dusk modes

There is no Level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 10.4 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

is provided in clause 10.5 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

=== Impacts on Portrayal Catalogues

There is no level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 10.6 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

=== Meta-features

There is no level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 10.7 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

=== Display of text

There is no level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 10.8 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

[[sec_A-6.9]]
=== Skin-of-the-earth operations and portrayal

[[sec_A-6.9.1]]
==== Skin-of-the-earth feature replacement and portrayal

For all Levels, anything that replaces S-101 skin-of-the-earth features
will overwrite it by having a higher priority; that is, be drawn later.
The major difference between the Levels is in the overwriting.

Interoperability operations in Level 1 overwrite skin-of-the-earth
features and everything else (by interleaving display planes so that
upper planes overwrite lower planes).

Gridded data will generally go over ENC and obscure ENC features,
either all (interoperability Level 0) or specific features (interoperability
Level 1) depending on interoperability Level chosen, the predefined
combinations or display plane of the features that are interacting.

[example]
High definition gridded bathymetry replaces (overwrites) depth area
and depth contours, but soundings, aids to navigation, and obstructions
are over the high definition bathymetry (interoperability Level 1).

NOTE: The safety contour comes from the ENC and is generated by the
viewer system. This safety contour is an IMO requirement (IMO Performance
Standard 5.8 (MSC.232(82))) for ECDIS and should be presented with
highest priority when turned on by the user. OEMs are permitted to
add additional safety contour functions; for example, generated from
combining high definition gridded bathymetry (S-102) and S-104 input.

[[sec_A-6.9.2]]
==== Skin-of-the-earth feature adjusting and portrayal

This clause covers the possibility of the skin-of-the-earth feature
geometry and/or attribute values being dynamically adjusted based
on the corresponding features in other data layers.

Changes to the location or extent of symbols displayed on the screen
due to a feature in another dataset are only possible in interoperability
Levels 3 and 4 (Parts C and D).

=== Blended portrayals

There is no Level-specific guidance for this issue. Common guidance
is provided in clause 10.10 of the "S-98 - Main" document.

=== Hierarchy of data

As noted in clause 11.11 of the "S-98 - Main" document, hierarchy
of data can be controlled by predefined combinations (Level 2 and
higher). Level 1 Catalogues offer only a very limited means of controlling
hierarchy by means of display plane ordering. There is no Level-specific
guidance for portrayal in connection with this issue.

[[sec_A-6.11.1]]
==== Interacting gridded information

There is no Level-specific guidance for portrayal in connection with
this issue. Common guidance is provided in clause 10.11.1 of the
"S-98 - Main" document.

=== Pick Reports

NOTE: The Pick Report functionality specification in S-98 is still
under development, and the content of this section will change as
this functionality is defined.

Clause 10.12 of the "S-98 - Main" document applies. There is no additional
Level-specific guidance for Level 1.

[[sec_A-7]]
== Processing Model

<<fig_A-7.1>> below shows the processing steps and input to each step
from parts of the Interoperability Catalogue, for the "Interoperability
before portrayal" processing option. <<fig_A-7.2>> shows the steps
and inputs for the "Interoperability after portrayal" processing option.
In both cases, the flow depends on the interoperability Level selected
by the mariner.

In Level 0 processing, interoperability is turned off and all data
products loaded are passed through to S-100 Portrayal Processing to
be portrayed as overlays to ENC data according to their individual
Portrayal Catalogues.

In Level 1 processing, the only interoperability processing is interleaving
of feature layers by means of display plane information, and Interleave
Feature Layers is the only interoperability processing before feature
data is passed to S-100 Portrayal Processing. The only input from
the Interoperability Catalogue is display plane and drawing order
information from *S100_IC_DisplayPlane* elements in the Catalogue.

<<fig_A-7.1;and!fig_A-7.2>> depict two possible implementations, with
the input to interoperability processing being either feature data
or drawing instructions generated from feature data by (part of) portrayal
processing.

[[fig_A-7.1]]
.Interoperability processing flow (portrayal processing after interoperability)
image::figure-a-7-1.png["",601,451]

For implementations that pass drawing instructions instead of features
to interoperability processing, the flow is similar except that portrayal
processing takes place before interoperability processing.
